# Safety & behavior
dry_run: true                 # Start in dry-run mode. Set to false to actually send signals.
ppid_exclude: [1]            # Never signal PPID 1 (systemd/init)
parent_name_exclude: [systemd, init]  # Do not kill parents with these names

# Signals & timing
kill_signal_term: "TERM"     # First attempt
kill_signal_kill: "KILL"     # Fallback if zombies persist
wait_after_term: 3           # Seconds to wait after SIGTERM before checking again
