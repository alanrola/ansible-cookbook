Ansible Automation Cookbook: Ready-to-use playbooks and roles, explained step by step.

# Ansible Playbooks and Roles – Community Cookbook

Welcome to my **personal collection of Ansible playbooks and roles**.  
This repository is meant to serve as a **community cookbook**: a set of simple, reusable, and well-documented examples for learning and practicing automation with Ansible.

---

## What’s inside?

- **Ready-to-use playbooks** → practical recipes (package installation, service configuration, patching, etc.).  
- **Reusable roles** → structured following Ansible best practices (defaults, handlers, tasks, templates, files).  
- **Step-by-step guides** → written so that even beginners can understand and use them.  
- **Good practices** → clear inventories, variable separation, and linting recommendations.

## Purpose

This project is **not intended as a production-ready library**.  
Instead, it is a **collection of learning materials** and **practical automation recipes** to inspire, adapt, and experiment with Ansible.

Feel free to use these playbooks as-is, modify them for your environment, or share ideas for improvement.

### This repository is a personal collection of Ansible examples, shared as a community resource.
